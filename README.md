# Suspicious Activity Prediction based on Deep Learning

Around 3 million people worldwide have been victims of some crime daily. In January 2020, Surfshark published in its data report that the increased number of cameras does not correlate with the global crime index. This is because, after a point, it is not possible to have enough security personnel keeping track of a multitude of cameras 24 x 7 for the cameras actually to have an impact. This project proposes a deep learning-based approach for detecting suspicious activities live from CCTV footage. This project proposes an ensemble model based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN) for the effective detection of suspicious activities and motionless objects in video data. The proposed ensemble model is trained on a large-scale dataset of labeled videos containing both normal and suspicious activities.
